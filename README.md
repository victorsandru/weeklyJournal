##### Learned about Markdown!
- Learned how to use Markdown files (.md)

##### Reviewed JavaScript on freeCodeCamp.org
Today I decided that I wanted to revise my skills in JavaScript, more specifically the latest ES6 version. I have never learned too much of the latest features but I am glad I reviewed. 

I learned how useful arrow functions are and will start implementing them in my code right away. I realized that most functions I used were never used more than once. Arrow functions solves that problem and simplifies my code.

```
var myConcatArray = function(arr1, arr2) {
  return arr1.concat(arr2);
};

```
Turns into 

```
const myConcatArray = (arr1, arr2) => arr1.concat(arr2);

```
Very useful!

 - Reviewed Linux System Administration course, learned about system and process monitoring tools such as 'top and 'ps'.

- Brain stormed some ideas on a discord bot. Debated between using Discord.js and  Discord.py. 

- I decided to use Discord.js so I can sharpen my JavaScript skills. Since discord.js uses Node.js, I had to read I read up on Node.js. Was a little confusing but after watching a YouTube video, the pieces start to fall together.
